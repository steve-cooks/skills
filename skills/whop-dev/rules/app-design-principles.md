## What Makes a Good Whop App

Suggestions from **Steven S, Whop Founder**. These are guidelines to consider, not strict requirements.

### 1. Empower Creators

Give creators customization so their whop stands out (e.g., custom prompts in AI apps, configurable branding, adjustable rules).
Basically have creators to be able to add some sort of customization to their instance of the app.

### 2. Drive Discovery

Create forum posts for activity happening inside your app. Activity in the feed breeds more engagement.

(IMPORTANT) Basically how shareable is the app or activities within the app? We want apps to have shareable features so that each user also can act as a node to attract more users to the app. And this shareability would compound more users over time.

### 3. Price Sustainably

Make money without gouging creators or customers. Consider free tiers, reasonable usage-based pricing, and scaling with creator success.

### 4. Keep UX Simple

Can a new user accomplish the main task in under 30 seconds? Minimize clicks, use progressive disclosure.
Able to deliver the core value of the app intuitively and quickly.

## Note

These are suggestions to improve app success on the platform. If a user requests something that conflicts with these principles, **prioritize the user's request**.
