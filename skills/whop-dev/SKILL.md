# Whop App Development

Build apps that run inside the Whop platform - handling authentication, payments, webhooks, and UI all with best practices.

## What Makes a Good Whop App (Suggestions)

From **Steven S, Whop Founder** - guidelines for app success (not requirements, user requests take priority):

| Principle | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Empower Creators** | Give customization so each whop feels unique |
| **Drive Discovery** | Create forum posts for activity |
| **Price Sustainably** | Make money without gouging creators or customers |
| **Keep UX Simple** | Core action obvious, minimal clicks |

**Details:** [app-design-principles.md](rules/app-design-principles.md)

## When to Use

**Empty repo / new project:**
- "Build me a Whop app" → Start with [app-from-scratch.md](rules/app-from-scratch.md)
- Guides through discovery, setup, and building from nothing

**Existing Whop project:**
- Jump directly to specific rules in Quick Reference below
- Adding payments → [payments-checkout.md](rules/payments-checkout.md)
- Adding auth → [auth-verify-token.md](rules/auth-verify-token.md)
- SDK issues → [sdk-setup.md](rules/sdk-setup.md)

## Companion Skills (Install First)

whop-dev focuses on Whop-specific patterns. For complete app development, **install these companion skills**:

```bash
npx skills add https://github.com/anthropics/skills --skill frontend-design && \
npx skills add https://github.com/vercel-labs/agent-skills --skill vercel-react-best-practices && \
npx skills add https://github.com/supabase/agent-skills --skill supabase-postgres-best-practices && \
npx skills add https://github.com/vercel-labs/agent-skills --skill web-design-guidelines
```

| Skill | Delegates To | When |
|-------|--------------|------|
| `frontend-design` | UI creation | Building components, pages, visual design |
| `vercel-react-best-practices` | Performance | React optimization, data fetching, bundles |
| `supabase-postgres-best-practices` | Database | Queries, schema, indexes, RLS |
| `web-design-guidelines` | UX review | Accessibility, design auditing |

**IMPORTANT**: When starting a new project or build-from-scratch flow, install companion skills FIRST before scaffolding. This enables whop-dev to hand off specialized work to expert skills.

See [companion-skills.md](rules/companion-skills.md) for detailed handoff patterns.

## How to Use

**Starting fresh (empty repo)?** → Follow [Build From Scratch](#build-from-scratch) - guided flow from idea to deployed app.

**Existing project?** → Jump to [Quick Reference](#quick-reference) for specific features.
